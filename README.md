# Zobel Aerial Photography

Custom small business website created in 2017.

## Overview

I developed this website while I was still in highschool during 2017. I had been developing websites for about a year at this point, and one of my friends asked for help making a website for his photography side hustle.

This project was one of the largest websites I had built at that time, and I learned an amazing amount of things by doing something that was completely my own  from the ground up. After building the static site here, I converted it into a WordPress theme and helped him host his own website.

Unfortunately, like most highschool dreams, Zobel Aerial Photography no longer exists today. However, the lessons that I learned building that site still apply to me today and greatly helped me launch my career forward.

Feel free to look through the code and try out the site, but keep in mind that during this time I was still new to web development and many of the decisions that I made in this site I would not make today.

## What I Learned

- **Design**. This is the first project where I really dug into web design to figure out how to not just make a website, but a great-looking website. Because I wasn't very comfortable at this point designing websites, I based the design theme off a [mockup on dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3498653--I-want-to-join-Intercom). You will see the colors and buttons look similar, but I designed the whole layout myself.

- **API's**. Probably the coolest part of this website is the live weather forecast section at the bottom. I used [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) for the API, and I updated the website using jQuery (*cringe*). Based on the response, I added an icon and status to the page. The animated icons were made on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jcsoriano18/pen/mERyNb). Looking back at this section, I definitely would do it different today, but this was a good introduction when I was first starting into the world of API's, async operations, and DOM manipulation.

- **Animations**: This website was a nice introduction to animation using CSS. I didn't do most of the animation myself, instead using icons from CodePen and wow.js, but it was a great way to start learning how animations work.

- **Responsive Design**: This website is fully responsive with a mobile menu and media queries.

- **Workflow**: I tried to use Gulp and Babel to organize and run tasks. If you look at the code, it's obvious that I had no idea what I was doing. However, this served as a good introduction as I would later use these tools when working on my university's yearbooks.

- **WordPress**: After building this site, I converted it into an entire WordPress theme. Unfortunately, I lost all of that code when the owner forgot to continue their GoDaddy subscription...
