I developed this website while I was still in highschool during 2017. I had been developing websites for about a year at this point, and one of my friends asked for help making a website for his drone side hustle.

This project was one of the largest websites I had built at that time, and I learned an amazing amount of things by doing something that was completely my own  from the ground up. After building the static site here, I converted it into a WordPress theme and helped him host his own website.

Unfortunately, like most highschool dreams, Zobel Aerial Photography no longer exists today. However, the lessons that I learned building that site still apply to me today and greatly helped me launch my career forward.

Feel free to look through the code and try out the site, but keep in mind that during this time I was still new to web development and many of the decisions that I made in this site I would not make today.
